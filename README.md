<H1> Revit Properties To Max Layers</H1>

<H3> This script will organise revit (.rvt) imports into max into layers based on whatever property you select.</H3>
When you import RVT files into max you have the option to include BIM data. This data can help organisation in max. This script will scan all objects in the scene and provide a dropdown menu of all available revit properties.
Then when you select one from the dropdown it gives you a count of how many layers youre about to create before generating them.

It works great as far as my testing goes but feel free to take it and improve as you see fit.
